# Heart of Iron IV Scenarios - 1942
    This repo contains the code used to create the required files for my Hearts of Iron 1942 Scenario.

## Consider the following:
### Balance
    <p>The first iteration of this mod is designed to match history as closely as possible. Units placement, technology researched and national focuses have been applied as historical as possible regardless of whether said technologies could have been researched or not within the same time frame in a regular game. </p>
    <p> Moving forward as work progresses considerations to game balancing will be implemented. For example, if authentic sources place were to show several divisions on one tile in the game, those divisions may be spread out in order to represent a continuous front (especially if not doing so would leave neighboring tiles unoccupied) </p>
### Research
    <p> Given the large amount of information to be gathered, research is currently being conduced in order to match historical events as closely as possible. This is an on going process and changes will be made as research is conducted. </p>

    <p> If you spot an inaccuracy please report a problem on the github page and provide a link or reference to you source. Wikipedia is NOT acceptable as a source to submit a correction </p>

    <p> While Wikepedia may not used as a source to offer corrections, it has been referenced in many (but not all) cases. The main reason for this is simply to get the mod up and running and bypass potential roadblocks where information is limited, incomplete or missing. </p>

## Germany
### Army Group North
    In the case of Army Group North, there were conflicting results after initial search. II corps is listed as only have 3 divisions in one place, yet 6 are listed in another. In  order for game balance in regards to the number of provences needing occupying forces, the larger list has been referenced. Sources also claim other small units such as Luftwaffe field units and several jaeger and ani-aircraft battalions.
